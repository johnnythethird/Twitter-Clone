We've started adding code to the backend of the server, but we're running into problems.\
The backend of the server is not running due to errors in the require field under resolvers.js.\
For some reason, most options I've tried to resolve the issue have come up fruitless.\
I will try to figure out the issue, but I'm not a fan of graphql so far.
